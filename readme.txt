-- Purpose: To create choreography for ballroom dance routines in order to practice or compete. The generated choreography follows national competition guidelines for possible combinations of moves.

-- Users may specify: 
		Dance style
		Difficulty level
		Number of moves to include
	Currently, the only available dance style is Cha Cha, but more will be added
	in future versions.

-- Once a routine has been generated, users may choose to:
		Get more information about an individual move
		Save the routine
		Edit sections of a routine
	(These are still being implemented)
